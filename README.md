# hello-world
## This a first tester repository for my COGS 108 git tutorial.

On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
I don't know what is going on but I am following a tutorial right now.
